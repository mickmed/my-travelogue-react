# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the day

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Complete
|Day 2| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Complete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Day 5| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Day 6| MVP | Incomplete

#### SAMPLE.....
#### MVP

## UI Components

Map

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Home | Single page app will render Map |
| Images | Seperate page to show images without map |



Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| Original Plan | Outcome | 
| Initiate App and Database| .5 | 
| Generate Models and Controllers| 2 |
| Research MapBox GL Gem | 2 |
| Render Basic Map in Page | 1 |
| Research Image Upload in Rails | 1 |
| Pin an Image to Map | 2 |
| Research storing image in Database|
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs |
